<h2>Introduction to Advanced Statistics</h2>
<p>Being a game that tests the endurance, skill and toughness of some of the world's top athletes, sports fans have enjoyed hockey for over a century due to the 
sheer unpredictability and chaos that takes place during each game. Despite being a game of heart-racing emotion, the amount of time the sport has been played has led
to some more dedicated fans recognizing distinct patterns that ultimately leads to a team's success and downfall. Some of these patterns are seen in a single game while others span across an entire season.
</p>
<p>With the rapid advancement of both mathematics and computing over the past two decades, the fans have slowly seen advanced statistics work their way into the sport. 
Gaining much of their popularity through baseball, the field of advanced statistics has boomed throughout the world of hockey during the 2010's. The fans who once noticed patterns that were essential for successful teams
have now had their thoughts brought to life through rigorous calculation. Over the past few seasons, these statistics, particularly those regarding puck possession, have proven to be an efficient measuring stick from separating good teams from the bad.
As of September 2014, eight teams in the NHL have hired advanced statisticians to keep a close eye on these numbers.</p>

<p>These new ways of measuring the games are developing quickly and are the future of the sport we all love. Take a look around this website if you wish
to learn more about them!</p>
</section>

<section id = "Reasons">
<h2> Why learn about advanced statistics?</h2>
<p>As many of us know, hockey fans are some of the most dedicated in sports. We all watch our team play 82 games a year and follow every last update about players and coaches. With these statistics gaining popularity, 
even the major media outlets have began using them in articles and featuring them on their website. In only a few short years understanding statistics such as Corsi, PDO and Zone Start Percentages will become a common
feature in all of the articles and web pages you read to follow the sport.</p>
<p>Besides becoming a norm in the future, advanced statistics allows you to know your team and the players in depth. No longer will you have to sit there with complete uncertainty if your favourite team is just on a hot streak or is a real contender to win the championship.
The days of guessing whether a player is coming into his own or is simply riding a streak of luck will be long gone. The opinions and views that you share with your fellow fans will have more merit with the new-found explanations you can provide. At the end of the day we all enjoy speculating and making predictions
about the sport. Advanced statistics provides you with the opportunity to gain some new insight that can be used to enhance your enjoyment of talking about and watching the sport!</p>

<section id = "Overview">
<h2>What can I find on this website?</h2>
<p>If you've decided to dive into advanced statistics and are a beginner, you have come to the right place! This site is primarily introductory, and was written to present advanced statistics to hockey fans that have not been
exposed to them yet. There are plenty of websites across the World Wide Web where you can access these statistics, read about new developments and even create and view your own graphs. This website intends to explain the bare essentials 
so that these websites can be accessed without the headache of having to research every term you come across!</p>

<p>In addition to this home page, users will have access to two more pages. One page gives an introduction to Corsi and Fenwick, which were two of the first advanced statistics. They are the most referenced advanced stat by the media
and were essentially the foundation that hockey analytics was built on. Both Corsi and Fenwick are meant to measure how well a team possesses the puck and generates scoring chancing. There are variants of both of these statistics which are briefly touched upon on that section of the website.</p>

<p>The second web page gives an extremely brief summary of all of the other mainstream statistics such as a player's offensive zone start percentage and PDO. This web page does not go into as much detail as the Corsi and Fenwick page but will make you familiar with what each statistic means. As one
ventures deeper into advanced hockey statistics they will undoubtedly find the general definitions and terms helpful in understanding the numbers.</p>
