<h1>Overview of Other Advanced Statistics</h1>

<article id="main">
<p>The reality of advanced hockeys statistics is that Corsi and Fenwick only paint part of the picture. There are dozens, if not hundreds of variables over the course of a game that can impact possession as well as the overall success of a team.
With this in mind, it is important to note that in order to truly understand the performance of a player or team, other statistics must be considered as well. As one could imagine, with so many variables to measure, the number of advanced statistics 
spans well beyond those presented on this page. From my experiences, these are some of the most referenced advanced stats that are relatively simple to understand.</p>

<tr>
<th><em>Statistic Name</em></th>
<th><em>Traditional Statistics Involved</em></th>
<th><em>What it measures</em></th>
<th><em>Relevance</em></th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>PDO</td>
<td>Shooting Percentage and Save Percentage</td>
<td>How much more (or less) often a shot for goes in than a shot against - Measures luck</td>
<td>The average PDO value is 100. A player with a PDO above 102 is probably not as good as they seem, while any player or team below 98 probably is not as bad as they seem.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Zone Starts</td>
<td>None</td>
<td>Ratio between offensive zone faceoffs to defensive zone faceoffs at even strength</td>
<td>Players with a high zone start ratio start in the offensive zone more often and have inflated Corsi/Fenwick totals. Players who have a low value start in the defensive zone more often and therefore have their Corsi/Fenwick totals deflated.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Adjusted Save Percentage (SV%+)</td>
<td>Save Percentage, Goals Allowed and Shots Against</td>
<td>Percentage of shots a goalie is saving relative to the league average</td>
<td>The league average save percentage is valued at a 100. Goalies above 100 are above average while those beneath are below average. Measures the difference between the number goals allowed by a goaltender relative to what an average goalie would allow if faced with the same number of shots (GSAA). </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Individual Points Percentage (IPP)</td>
<td>Points and Goals For</td>
<td>The percentage of the team's goals that a particular player gained a point or assist on. </td>
<td>Shows us exactly how reliant an offense is on the production of a particular player. A player with a higher IPP will be responsible for either scoring or assisting more of/on a higher quantity of the team's goals.</td>
</tr>
